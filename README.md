# UFOs
UFO Sightings with JavaScript

## Overview of Project
A client wants for us to display a table organizing UFO data stored as a JavaScript array. She also requested the ability for filters to allow users with multiple search criterias. The table was created using JavaScript and modified through HTML/CSS, adding additional filters for each city, state, country, and shape.

## Resources
- Software:
  - JavaScript
  - HTML/CSS
  - Visual Studio Code
  
## Results:
- Upon arrival of the site, we are prompted with a filtered search section that will allow us to specify when and where each UFO sighting has occured.

- When we perform a search, making sure the beginning of each letter is in lowercase due to case sensitivity and removing any unnecessary characters, our results are shown as below.

- Selecting "enter" or clicking off the criteria search box will automatically input our search. In order to reset the results, we would have to refresh the page.


## Summary
## Drawback
- One drawback of this page would be that searches are case sensitive and must be typed directly as shown from the list. Uppercase and lowercase words do not show the same result as searches with an extra voidable character. The searches have to be very specific and that may cause some trouble with new visiting users.

## Recommendations
- In order to increase user accessibility, there should be an autocorrect or spellcheck function that will allow all different ways of spelling to filter to a specifically intended key word. This way, users do not have to worry about typing an exact search and having to worry about upper and lower case sensibility.
- Adding a calendar function where users are able to click on an exact date through a calender instead of typing it out would save much more time and will make the search process very easily understandable. Since UFO sightings aren't as common as we'd hope, maybe we can filter out the results by month, year, or most recent.
